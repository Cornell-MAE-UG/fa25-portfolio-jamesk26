## About Me


![Profile Picture]({{ "/workspaces/fa25-portfolio-jamesk26/assets/images/jamesportrait (1).jpeggit add ." | relative_url }}){: class="profile-image"}

 
My name is {{ site.name }}, and I am a British-American mechanical engineer studying at Cornell University. I was born in England and moved to the U.S. at age 5, an experience that gave me a global perspective and a drive to make an impact wherever I go.

I’m passionate about engineering design, manufacturing, and problem-solving — from prototyping carbon-fiber steering wheels with Cornell’s Formula SAE team, to developing efficient manufacturing solutions during my internship at Shaw Harbor Holdings. I thrive at the intersection of hands-on mechanical design, testing, and business strategy, and I’m especially interested in automotive engineering, composites, and advanced manufacturing processes.

Beyond the classroom and lab, I enjoy working on my BMW 335i, exploring the Adirondack Mountains, and competing in track & field and skiing. These passions fuel my creativity, resilience, and curiosity — qualities I bring into every engineering project.

My GitHub showcases projects that reflect both my technical knowledge (CAD, machining, thermal testing, microcontrollers, Python) and my passion for building things that combine efficiency, performance, and real-world impact.
