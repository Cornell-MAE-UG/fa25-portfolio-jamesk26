To solve this problem, I designed a mechanism using a rigid base bar with two pin supports mounted on the ground, spaced 50cm apart. A third pin support is placed above, connecting to a second bar. I selected an "Nsx" linear actuator (using its maximum force value from an online catalog) to push the second bar upward, acting as a lever to lift a weight at the end. This configuration allows the mechanism to lift the maximum possible weight to the highest possible height within the 150cm by 50cm design space, with all supports, bars, and the actuator considered rigid.
